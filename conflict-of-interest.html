                    <div class="unit-body">
                        <p class="text-black"><span class="font-weight-bold">The purpose of the Conflict of Interest Policy is:</span>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-black-05">Charitable organizations are frequently subject to intense public scrutiny, especially where they appear to have inappropriately benefited their Officers, Directors, or Trustees. The IRS also has an oversight role with respect
                            to charitable organizations. An important part of this oversight is providing organizations with strategies that will help avoid the appearance or actuality of private benefit to individuals who are in a position of substantial
                            authority. The recommended conflict of interest policy is a strategy we encourage organizations to adopt as a means to establish procedures that will offer protection against charges of impropriety involving officers, directors,
                            or trustees.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-05">A conflict of interest occurs where individuals’ obligation to further the organization’s charitable purposes is at odds with their own financial interests. For example, a conflict of interest would occur where an Officer, Director,
                            or Trustee votes on a contract between the organization and a business that is owned by the officer, director or trustee. Conflicts of interest frequently arise when setting compensation or benefits for officers, directors,
                            or trustees. A conflict of interest policy is intended to help ensure that when actual or potential conflicts of interest arise, the organization has a process in place under which the affected individual will advise the governing
                            body about all the relevant facts concerning the situation. A conflict of interest policy is also intended to establish procedures under which individuals who have a conflict of interest will be excused from voting on such
                            matters.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-black-05">Apart from any appearance of impropriety, organizations will lose their tax-exempt status unless they operate in a manner consistent with their charitable purposes. Serving private interests more than insubstantially is inconsistent
                            with accomplishing charitable purposes. For example, paying an individual who is in a position of substantial authority excessive compensation serves a private interest. Providing facilities, goods, or services to an individual
                            who is in a position of substantial authority also serves a private interest unless the benefits are part of a reasonable compensation arrangement or they are available to the public on equal terms and conditions.</p>

                            <u>PURPOSES</u>
                        </h6>
                        <p class="text-black-05">It is important for Transcontinental Humanitarian Corp. directors, officers, and staff to be aware that both real and apparent conflicts of interest or dualities of interest sometimes occur in the course of conducting the affairs
                            of the corporation and that the appearance of conflict can be troublesome even if there is in fact no conflict whatsoever. Conflicts occur because the many persons associated with the corporation should be expected to have,
                            and do in fact generally have multiple interests and affiliations and various positions of responsibility within the community. In these situations a person will sometimes owe identical duties of loyalty to two or more corporations.
                            The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect the corporation’s tax-exempt interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or
                            director of the corporation or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction. The policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit
                            and charitable organizations.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-05">Conflicts are undesirable because they potentially or eventually place the interests of others ahead of the corporation’s obligations to its charitable purposes and to the public interest. Conflicts are also undesirable because
                            they often reflect adversely upon the person involved and upon the institutions with which they are affiliated, regardless of the actual facts or motivations of the parties. However, the long-range best interests of the corporation
                            do not require the termination of all association with persons who may have real or apparent conflicts that are harmless to all individuals or entities involved.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-05">Each member of the board of directors and the staff of the corporation has a duty of loyalty to the corporation. The duty of loyalty generally requires a director or staff member to prefer the interests of the corporation over
                            the director’s/staff’s interest or the interests of others. In addition, directors and staff of the corporation shall avoid acts of self-dealing which may adversely affect the tax-exempt status of the corporation or cause there
                            to arise any sanction or penalty by a governmental authority.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-05">In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors and members
                            of committees with governing board delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.</p>
